    The <a href="https://www.spaceclimateobservatory.org/fr/cimopolee" target="_blank">CIMOPOLEE</a> project aims providing rapid qualitative and quantitative information on the impact of cyclones and monitoring the resilience of affected areas over on Madagascar.
    <br>
    The project is led and coordinated by the UMR <a href="https://www.espace-dev.fr/en/home/" target="_blank">Espace-Dev</a> from the <a href="http://www.seas-oi.org/" target="_blank">SEAS-OI</a> station in Reunion.
    It involves members of the <a href="https://www.univ-reunion.fr/" target="_blank">University of La Reunion</a> and <a href="https://en.ird.fr/" target="_blank">IRD</a> based in La Reunion, Montpellier, and Madagascar.
    <br>
    The stakeholders of the project in Madagascar are the Antananarivo Geophysical Institute and Observatory (IOGA) and the Institute of Science and Technology (IST) for the scientific part, and the National Office for Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC) for the operational part.
    <br>
    It is funded by <a href="https://cnes.fr/en" target="_blank">CNES</a> and has been accredited by the <a href="https://www.spaceclimateobservatory.org/" target="_blank">Space Climate Observatory (SCO) International Initiative</a>.

    CIMOPOLEE, an operational application in the frame of the ReNovRisk-Impact project:
</div>

<br>

<div class="sentence">
    In order to move forward on these issues, the UMR Espace-Dev has been developing tools and automated processing chains around Sentinel-1 and 2 data for the past 5 years. These tools were initiated between 2018 and 2021, through the Interreg project ReNovRisk-Impact.
    Dedicated to the economic evaluation of the impact of cyclones on Madagascar and Reunion Island, this project has shown, through several case studies, the potential of such tools and Sentinel satellite images to carry out an inventory and monitoring of the impact of natural hazards (particularly floods) with regular information on a fine spatial scale.
    <br>
    The CIMOPOLEE project builds on these already functional developments to set up an operational online tool that will integrate data on the scale of major natural disasters from Sentinel-1 and 2 satellite images. This project is intended to be a pioneer in setting up a permanent tool for risk managers in Madagascar and scientists who monitor the impact of these events.
